<h1>Atomistique</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project has been taken during my first year of preparatory class, it was the first time I could put together my chemsitry knowledge with my coding skills. The program is quiet complex in the way that if we don't know anything about chemistry, it can be a little hard to understand what it demonstrates. It uses Tkinter and POO. The code is one of the longest I have made and it was very satisfying to do. There is a file named explaination.docx that goes into details for every function of the program (in french).

Here is another example, you can choose the atome you want to display by its atomic number, or by its name, choosing to add or remove ions<br/>

There are other functions that allow you to get several chemical informations that you can find in the program and detailed in the docx file.<br/>
